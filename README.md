## React Frontend Application
<strong>Assignment:</strong> Create an application using a framework. The teacher gave us the framework we had to work with, in my case, it's the React Framework.

## How to install
Download the project files
navigate to the root folder
> $npm install

> $npm start

## Research
In these two weeks, we got the opportunity to help Arjen out with his risk calculation dashboard. A dashboard used to calculate the potential risk of children being placed into someone else's custody, due to harm or neglect.

When I opened the dashboard I quickly realized that it actually already does a good job of calculating the risk. But the user experience was not really good.
I decided that I wanted to enhance the user experience of the current app. In order to do that I had to figure out what was wrong with it and how I could do better.
A couple of things I noticed right away:

- Can't save data.
- Big lists (a lot of information right away).
- No forgiveness from the UI whenever a user makes a mistake.

After using it a couple of times I noticed a few other things:
- All the questions are predefined (not bad, just good to know).
- All the questions are inside a select menu, this means extra mouse clicks.
- There's so much information (cognitive overload).

## Concept
I wanted to make an app which the users could use with just their smartphone. We had some feedback from the target audience in which they said:
- Usually, we don't use the dashboard/laptop at the first meeting because being digital can stand in the way of building trust with the client.
    - Which means they write down or remember everything and fill in the information at a later time.

## Roadmap
- [x] Make it faster for users to select an answer.
- [ ] Save the information locally, if the user refreshes data isn't lost.
- [ ] Separate the questions, return them in easier to read bits.
- [ ] Redesign the dashboard
- [ ] Alerts/reminders when a question hasn't been answered yet. (Maybe hiding questions that have been answered)


## Challenges
React itself was a big challenge for me. Prior to this assignment, I haven't really used any sort of framework and it felt like I had to start at the very beginning.
The syntax was different, JSX was hard to wrap my head around. But in just a couple of days, I learned a lot about React.

### Stateless Function Component
Sometimes components will be so simple, that they will only do one thing. If you don't need other methods inside your component other then the render method. In that case, we can use stateless functions:

<strong>Stateless Function Component</strong>
```jsx
const Example = (props) => {
    return (
            <header>
                <h1>This will always be the same</h1>
            </header>
        )
}

export default Example
```
<strong>Full React Component (in which you can use more methods)</strong>
``` jsx
class Example extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <header>
                <h1>This will always be the same</h1>
            </header>
        )
    }
}

export default Example
```
For my project, I tried using both, but after refactoring my code a couple of times I don't have that many separate components.

### States vs Props
With a state, you can only access information that is available inside the component.

``` jsx
class AnotherExample extends React.Component {
    state = {
        name: "Jamie"
    }
    render() {
        return (
            <div>Hello {this.state.name}</div>
        )
    }
}
```

``` jsx
class AnotherExample extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <div>Hello {this.props.name}</div>
        )
    }
}

<AnotherExample name="Jamie"/>
```

We can pass properties to the component using attributes. Then we can access them inside the component.
